                            Cube Space is an innovative application aimed at enhancing access to South African art. 
                            Through the utilization of tools like <b>Figma</b> for wireframes and prototypes, <b>Miro </b>for mapping and data organization,
                            and <b>Lookback</b> for user testing, Cube Space fosters an inclusive platform for exploring and engaging with diverse artistic expressions.

                        <p>
                            Art galleries serve as vital hubs for fostering creativity, inspiration, and therapeutic exploration. Nonetheless, 
                            they often present challenges for individuals with an interest in art, especially those lacking extensive knowledge, 
                            particularly in the context of South African art.My primary objective with Cube Space is to transform this 
                            landscape into an inclusive platform, ensuring accessibility for all users. I strive to curate a cohesive and 
                            immersive gallery experience, offering comprehensive insights into the rich tapestry of South African artworks 
                            showcased within the space.

                            <li>Key findings during the initial stages of my research were that there is a lack of documentation and information about South African artists.</li>
                            <li>For some, art galleries are gatekeeping and exclusionary spaces that impact experience in a negative way.</li>
                            <li>English as the only medium of instruction in a country with 11 official languages is problematic because it excludes a large demographic that wishes to enter the space.</li>
                            <li>Participants expressed that they would go to gallariess more often if there was more information about what they were looking at.</li>
                            <li>Most participants go to galleries to socialize and would feel more confident conversing with others if they had accessible information of the artwork they were viewing.</li>

                               Beginning with the inception of the idea, I meticulously crafted the prototype using Figma, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user interface. 
                              I Developed the app in <b>HTML</b>, <b>React</b>, and <b>Bootstrap </b>to bring the vision to life, focusing on user-centric design principles to optimize functionality and accessibility.

                              This initiative was created when as an ESL educator in Asia, where I encountered the challenge of engaging
                              teenagers in the classroom and facilitating their active participation in the learning process. To address this, I created a dynamic solution 
                              in the form of an interactive quiz application, developed to ignite interest and spark  healthy competition among students.
                              This was an impactful project as it increased student engagement, reading comprehension, and overall participation in the learning journey. 
                              By transforming traditional review sessions into captivating quiz experiences, students embraced the opportunity to reinforce their understanding of key concepts
                               while enjoying a sense of camaraderie and excitement in the classroom.
